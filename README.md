## project overview
This is a VERY, very rough sketch of how the encryption would work. :)


## how does it work??
- The QuantumEncryption class handles the generation of quantum keys and the encryption/decryption process using these keys.
_init__(self): Initializes the quantum backend (simulator). The quantum circuit will be executed here :P
generate_quantum_key(self, length=16):
This method creates a quantum key by generating quantum states using the Hadamard gate (qc.h(range(length))), which creates superposition states.
The quantum key is generated by measuring the qubits, producing random bits each time the quantum circuit is executed.
It returns the quantum key as a binary string.
encrypt(self, data, key):
This method encrypts the provided data (which is hashed using SHA-256) using the XOR operation between the hashed data and the quantum key.
XOR (exclusive OR) operation is applied between each byte of the hashed data and the corresponding bit from the quantum key.
It returns the encrypted data.
decrypt(self, encrypted_data, key):
This method decrypts the encrypted data using the same XOR operation to recover the original data. It works because XORing the same key twice restores the original data.

- The BioFeedbackAuth class handles the biometric data capture and authentication process.
__init__(self):
Initializes the QuantumEncryption instance, which will be used for the encryption/decryption of biometric data.
capture_biofeedback(self):
This method simulates capturing biofeedback data, such as a heartbeat (random value between 60 and 100 bpm) and brainwave (random value between 0.1 and 30.0 Hz).
It returns a string formatted as HB:<heartbeat>|BW:<brainwave> representing the biofeedback.
authenticate(self, biofeedback):
This method takes the captured biofeedback data and generates a quantum key using generate_quantum_key.
The biofeedback data is then encrypted using the quantum encryption method encrypt().

- The main block runs the program and simulates the biofeedback authentication process:
The BiofeedbackAuth object is instantiated.
Biofeedback data (heartbeat and brainwave) is captured.
This data is then encrypted using quantum encryption.
Finally, the captured biofeedback, encrypted data, and the quantum key are printed to the console.
