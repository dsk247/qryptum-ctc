# Quantum Encrypted Biofeedback

## Project Overview
Quantum Encrypted Biofeedback combines quantum encryption and biofeedback data to create a highly secure, real-time authentication method.

## How It Works
- **Quantum Encryption**: We use quantum mechanics principles to encrypt biofeedback data, making it impossible to intercept or tamper with.
- **Biofeedback**: Collects real-time data (e.g., heart rate, skin response) to verify identity continuously.

## Getting Started
To run the project locally:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Quantum-Encrypted-Biofeedback.git`
2. Install dependencies (if any).
3. Run the example script to see how the encryption works with biofeedback data.

## Future Enhancements
- Multi-modal Authentication.
- Integration of Homomorphic Encryption.
- Real-time risk assessment.
