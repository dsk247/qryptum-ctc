# Quantum Encrypted Biofeedback

## Project Overview
Quantum Encrypted Biofeedback combines quantum encryption and biofeedback data to create a highly secure, real-time authentication method.

## How It Works
- **Quantum Encryption** We use quantum mechanics principles to encrypt biofeedback data, making it impossible to intercept or tamper with.
- **Biofeedback** Collects real-time data (e.g., heart rate, skin response) to verify identity continuously.
